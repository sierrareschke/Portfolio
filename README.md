# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! Please see the included links below to access the individual repositories for projects I have completed or am currently working on.

## Projects
- [SkiWise: Data-Driven Ski Trip Optimization Using Real-Time Analytics and Machine Learning (Python)](https://github.com/MichelleGjolberg/SkiWise/tree/backend-recent-snowfall): Team project developing a full-stack ski trip optimization tool using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React, integrating Google Maps and weather APIs to filter and rank 35 CO ski resorts based on real-time snowfall, road conditions, and user-defined preferences. GitHub link will become public upon project completion. (Current)
- [Collaborative Trip Planner as a Service (Python)](https://github.com/sierrareschke/Collaborative-Trip-Planner): A collection of distributed components that will enable users to more easily plan and share travel itineraries. (Fall 2024)
- [Object-Oriented Design Polymorphism Maze Adventure Game (Java)](https://github.com/sierrareschke/OOD-Maze-Game): A multi-iteration adventure game focusing on implementing object-oriented design principles and patterns. (Fall 2024)
- [Deep Learning for Neuroscience using OOP Principles and Best Practices (Python)](https://github.com/nolanrbrady/neuro_dl_stats): Exploration of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles within deep learning and neural network architectures. (Fall 2024)
- [Wildfire Data Mining and Analysis (Python)](https://github.com/sierrareschke/Wildfire-Analysis): Data mining and deep learning project exploring wildfire impacts on unemployment (Fall 2024).
