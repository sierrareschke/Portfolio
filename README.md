# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! Please see the included links below to access the individual repositories for projects I have completed or am currently working on.

## Projects
- Farm-NG Amiga Autonomous Robotics Capstone (Python): Multi-semester project developing an autonomous navigation and perception system for a Farm-NG Amiga robot. Involves camera-based vision, control feedback, and modular software design for straight-line driving and waypoint tracking. (Fall 2025 – Spring 2026)
- [SemEval 2026 NLP Emotion Modeling (Python)](https://github.com/trar3243/Semeval2026Group8): Developed RoBERTa-based models to predict arousal and valence from ecological essays using multi-variant architectures, custom losses, and ensemble logic. (Fall 2025)
- [Wiland Engineering Internship Projects (Python, C++, TypeScript)](https://github.com/sierrareschke/Wiland-Internship-Summer2025): Collection of backend software engineering projects completed as part of my Software Engineering Internship at Wiland. Includes tools for data pipeline automation, Tableau Hyper file generation, REST API refactoring, and endpoint testing. (Summer 2025)
- [SkiWise: Data-Driven Ski Trip Optimization Using Real-Time Analytics and Optimization (Python)](https://github.com/MichelleGjolberg/SkiWise): Team project developing a full-stack ski trip optimization tool. Utilizes Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React and integrates Google Maps and weather APIs to filter and rank 23 CO ski resorts based on real-time snowfall, road conditions, and user-defined preferences. Note: The live link may load slowly or be temporarily unavailable if the database instance is paused (due to student cloud credits). (Spring 2025)
- [Collaborative Trip Planner as a Service (Python)](https://github.com/sierrareschke/Collaborative-Trip-Planner): A collection of distributed components that will enable users to more easily plan and share travel itineraries. (Fall 2024)
- [Object-Oriented Design Polymorphism Maze Adventure Game (Java)](https://github.com/sierrareschke/OOD-Maze-Game): A multi-iteration adventure game focusing on implementing object-oriented design principles and patterns. (Fall 2024)
- [Deep Learning for Neuroscience using OOP Principles and Best Practices (Python)](https://github.com/nolanrbrady/neuro_dl_stats): Exploration of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles within deep learning and neural network architectures. (Fall 2024)
- [Wildfire Data Mining and Analysis (Python)](https://github.com/sierrareschke/Wildfire-Analysis): Data mining and deep learning project exploring wildfire impacts on unemployment (Fall 2024).
- [Custom Convolutional Neural Network for MRI Classification (Python)](https://github.com/sierrareschke/brain_mri_cnn.git): Machine learning and CNN project focused on classification of brain tumor MRI images. (Summer 2023)
- [Java Programming III Course Projects (Java)](https://github.com/sierrareschke/Java-CS400-projects.git): Repository to access all projects completed as part of the Java Programming III Course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Designed and implemented full-stack software projects utilizing object-oriented and functional programming, data structures, and complexity analysis, incorporating industry-standard development practices, version control, and user-interface design. (Spring 2024)
- [Java Programming II Course Projects (Java)](https://github.com/sierrareschke/Java-CS300-projects.git): Repository to access all projects completed as part of the Java Programming II Course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. These projects reinforced best practices in software design, debugging, and testing, developing skills in problem-solving, modular programming, and real-world application development. (Fall 2023)
